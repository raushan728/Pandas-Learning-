# 📊 Pandas-Learning

🚀 **My Pandas Learning Journey**  
Hi! 👋 I'm currently learning **Pandas**, a powerful data analysis library in Python. This repository contains my hands-on practice notebooks, notes, and small examples as I explore Pandas step by step using **Jupyter in VS Code**.

## 📌 Current Learning Topics  
- 📘 Creating Series and DataFrames  
- 📘 Indexing and Slicing  
- 📘 Reading data from CSV/Excel files  
- 📘 Filtering and selecting data  
- 📘 Handling missing values  
- 📘 GroupBy and aggregation  
- 📘 Merging and joining  
- 📘 Data cleaning and transformation
